We did not use any plugins or other tools in the project.
It should work when the project is opened.

We have UML diagrams for all of the classes are found in the phase2 directory as a .pdf file.

Our three games are in randomized order in which players can choose to either play the game as a
single player or double player. This includes a login screen for one (or two, depending on the
number of players) people. The scores are tracked throughout all games and are written onto a
leader board, if the player chooses to save their score.

Burger Builder
There is a menu card at the top of the screen. The objective is to catch as many desired ingredients
as possible, which change as the player catches correct ingredients. Each desired ingredient that is
caught increases the score of the player. If a desired ingredient is not caught, falling beyond the
screen, then the player loses a life. If the player catches the wrong ingredient or their number of
lives reaches zero, the game will end immediately.

Maze
There is a player who is spawned in the first open space and is controlled by the joystick and loses
health over time. If the good food is eaten, demonstrated by the steak, the player's score increases
and their health increases. If a bad food is eaten, drawn as the toxic symbol, the payer loses a
life. When the health bar of the player reaches zero, as the red horizontal bar above the joystick,
or when the number of lives reaches zero, the game ends. The maze that is given to the player is
randomly generated among 10 preset mazes of different sizes.

Fruit fly dodge
The player is the finger of the phone holder. Flies enter the screen at the top and are generated
randomly among 4 different types of fly movements. A life is lost when the player's finger is hit
by a fly. If a fly is avoided and leaves the screen, the player's score increases. The game ends
when their number of lives reaches zero or their finger is lifted off the screen.
